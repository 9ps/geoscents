<h1>Geopolitical Anomalies</h1>
<p>This page discusses some of the political anomalies present in the game.  This discussion is the result of valuable player feedback!</p>

<h3>Czechia v.s. Czech Republic</h3>
In 2016, the United Nations officially recognized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_the_Czech_Republic">Czechia</a> as the shortened version of the name for this country, and it has been published to UNTERM and UNGEGN databases.  This game uses the cities database found at <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities">simplemaps</a>, which also uses the name Czechia.  

<h3>Red borders</h3>
This game uses python's cartopy library to generate maps.  It fetches data from the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/">Natural Earth Data features database</a>.  
The red borders, such as the lines around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara">Western Sahara</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilemi_Triangle">the Ilemi Triangle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)">Palestine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Control">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, mark disputed territories and breakaway regions.
A list of disputed territories can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes">here</a>.

<h3>The Bubble in Kazakhstan</h3>
The strange circle in Kazakhstan is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>. 
It is a space launch facility that was leased by the Kazakh government to Russia until 2050.

<h3>Kosovo</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo">Kosovo</a> is shown as a regular (non-disputed red border) in this map.  
According to the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/">Natural Earth Data features database</a>, Kosovo is a real country even though about 49% of UN nations recognize it.
