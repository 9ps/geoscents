      <h3><a href="#1" id="1">Data Visualizations</a></h3>
      <div>
          <p>One of the fun things that this game allows me to do is to collect how well people from around the world know where things are.  I use your public IP address to identify your country and collect your play history securely on the game server.  If you do not want your game to be tracked, see the "Chat Box Commands" section below to learn how to mask your activity.  Tracking this information allows me to build a database and visualizations of how people from around the world perform.  This is a fun dataset to browse, especially to answer questions such as "How do Germans compare to Americans at knowing European cities? American cities? Chinese cities?" or "How often do people mix up Paraguay and Uruguay?"</p>
          <p>I have put together visualizations and data tables at <a href="https://geoscents.net/plots/index.html">https://geoscents.net/plots/index.html</a> that are automatically updated daily.  Feel free to explore that page and point out any interesting things you find.
      </div>
      <h3><a href="#2" id="2">Trivia Entries</a></h3>
      <div>
          <p>The trivia map contains hundreds of random events, places, and things that have well-defined latitude and longitude.  The database that it draws from was hand-made by myself continues to grow.  The original Geosense game did not have this game, but I thought it would be a fun addition, considering all the javascript machinery is in place to have players hunt down whatever things have a lat/lon definition.  Many of the entries have flags embedded in them, as well as the entry written in the native script of whatever country or culture they are part of, to help your ability to pinpoint them.  </p>
          <p>The entries are mostly things that I found browsing wikipedia and <a href="www.atlasobscura.com">Atlas Obscura</a> and fall roughly into these categories:
<ul>
            <li> UNESCO World Heritage sites - Taj Mahal, Machu Picchu, Moai Statues at Easter Island, etc.</li>
            <li>Funny names - Fucking, Austria, Sandwich, Illinois, Batman, Turkey, Hell, Norway, that town in New Zealand with a ridiculously long name, etc.</li>
            <li>Ancient cities - Tyre, Phoenicia, Karakorum, Mongol Empire, Bagan, Pagan Kingdom, etc.</li>
            <li>Major historical incidents - Hannibal defeats Rome at the Battle of Cannae, Tsar Bomba test site, Sinking of the RMS Lusitania, Chernobyl incident, etc.</li>
            <li>Odd statues - Manneken Pis, Blucifer, Christ of the Abyss, etc.</li>
            <li>National parks - Yosemite, Joshua Tree, Banff, Zhangjiajie, etc.</li>
            <li>Notable Buildings - CN Tower, The Kremlin, The Whitehouse, etc.</li>
            <li>Scientific sites - Neanderthal Valley, the Michelson-Morley experiment, Ivan Pavlov's dog study</li>
            <li>Sporting Events - Various world cup and olymic games locations</li>
            <li>Geological points of interest - locations of coldest/hottest recorded temperatures, tallest mountains of each continent, Marianas Trench, etc. </li>
            <li>Other things that I'm not sure how to categorize - Where the US accidentally dropped a nuclear bomb on itself (Goldsboro, NC), Wakaliwood Film Studio, etc. 
          </ul>
        I hope that at least some of them spark your interest and get you to click the "Learn" link in the bottom right box of the game so you can read about it afterwards.  Some of these entries may be "famous" things that are worth knowing, but some of them are just silly so I hope you don't take it too seriously.</p>
          <p>Please reach out by sending a message starting with the word /feedback if you want to suggest new trivia items!  I love hearing your feedback, and am especially interested in growing the database beyond the cultural bias of the few people who have contributed already.</p>

      <h3><a href="#3" id="3">Geopolitical Anomalies</a></h3>
      <div>
          <p>This page discusses some of the political anomalies present in the game.  This discussion is the result of valuable player feedback!</p>

<h3>Czechia v.s. Czech Republic</h3>
In 2016, the United Nations officially recognized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_the_Czech_Republic">Czechia</a> as the shortened version of the name for this country, and it has been published to UNTERM and UNGEGN databases.  This game uses the cities database found at <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities">simplemaps</a>, which also uses the name Czechia.  

<h3>Red borders</h3>
This game uses python's cartopy library to generate maps.  It fetches data from the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/">Natural Earth Data features database</a>.  
The red borders, such as the lines around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara">Western Sahara</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilemi_Triangle">the Ilemi Triangle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)">Palestine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Control">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, mark disputed territories and breakaway regions.
A list of disputed territories can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_territorial_disputes">here</a>.

<h3>The Bubble in Kazakhstan</h3>
The strange circle in Kazakhstan is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>. 
It is a space launch facility that was leased by the Kazakh government to Russia until 2050.

<h3>Kosovo</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo">Kosovo</a> is shown as a regular country in this map.  
According to the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/">Natural Earth Data features database</a>, Kosovo is a real country even though about 49% of UN nations recognize it.

      <h3><a href="#4" id="4">Game FAQ</a></h3>
      <div>

<h3>City Selection</h3>
Cities are selected from the <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities">simplemaps</a> database.  For the most part, each game of 11 rounds should only include one city per country.
The exceptions are:
<ul>
  <li>For the Asia, N. America, and Oceania maps, China, India, U.S., Canada, and Mexico can be repeated as long as the administrative name (province, state, or territory) is different.</li>
  <li>The game make 20 attempts to find a random city whose country and/or administrative name has not already been used.  If it has still failed, it will just give whatever city.  This happens most often in Oceania and S. America maps.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
Your score is based on your distance to the city and how quickly you clicked.
The maximum score you can get per round is <b>600</b>, so the max score for an 11 round game is <b>6600</b>.  
Because the game uses Mercator projections with the latitude of true scale set to the equator (even on the continent maps), this means that your distance in km is more forgiving as you move away from the equator.

The equations used to calculate score are <a href="https://github.com/mattfel1/geoscents/blob/d66b57b7a429370c7af9725d32c7610894c7176e/server/geography.js#L194-L210">here</a>.  They are roughly:<br><br>
timeComponent = min(1, 1 - 0.07843 * (t - 1.6))<br>
distComponent = min(600, e^(-sf * (sf*dist)^2 / 600000)*605)<br>
score = timeComponent * distComponent<br><br>

sf is a scaling factor, which is computed by the diagonal of the world map, in km, divided by the diagonal of the map you are playing on.<br>
dist is the distance you are to the city, in km.<br>  For reference, the scaling factors for each of the maps are shown below.  This means that Europe, Oceania, and S. America are the "hardest" map, because each pixel represents far fewer km than on other maps.<br>
<ul>
<li> World = 1 </li>
<li> Europe = 3.38 </li>
<li> Africa = 1.30 </li>
<li> Asia = 1.77 </li>
<li> Oceania = 1.30 </li>
<li> N. America = 2.26 </li>
<li> S. America = 1.35 </li>
</ul>
t is how many seconds elapsed before you clicked (i.e. 10 minus time remaining in round).<br><br>

These plots show how the two score components work for the World map (sf = 1).<br>

<h3>Record Keeping</h3>
The game resets every day at midnight GMT.  Sorry if you are playing a game during the reboot!  You should see plenty of warnings in the minutes leading up to the game reset.<br>
Sometimes the Weekly records are better than the Monthly records.  This is because these are the cronjobs that run the game:<br><br>

0 0 * * * bash /root/startdaily.sh <br>
0 0 * * * rm /scratch/*day* <br>
0 0 * * 1 rm /scratch/*week* <br>
0 0 1 * * rm /scratch/*month* <br>
0 0 1 1 * rm /scratch/*all-time* <br><br>


Therefore, it is possible for the monthly records to get reset on the first of the month, but the weekly records will not get reset until the first day of the week.

      <h3><a href="#7" id="7">Donate</a></h3>
      <div>
Thank you so much for playing the game!  It has been amazing to see people from around the world log on and compete against each other and engage in supportive dialogue as well as geography trash talk.  I spend most of my time programming in Verilog/VHDL, Scala, and C++ for my day job but really craved this game ever since I learned that geosense.net ceased to exist.  I learned just enough javascript and web development to throw this game together and approximate the experience I used to have playing the original game.  <br><br>I have a year of credits on Google Cloud so I will be able to host the game until around May 2021 before it will start costing. If you insist on donating, please consider donating to one of the causes in the lobby instead.  They are doing much more important work than hosting a geography game!

        <h3><a href="#9" id="9">Player History Logging</a></h3>
        <div>
There is now a player history logger that you can opt-in to.  This is the plan for now to provide pseudo-accounts.  I am against implementing true accounts on this website for two reasons.  First, I do not trust myself to implement password handling securely (and neither should you).  Second, I do not want there to be both a guest mode and account mode because this inherently makes some players feel "inferior" to others.  This game will remain as simple as possible, where you just enter a username and color.
<br><br>
Some people are repeat users and I think they would be interested to see how they progress over time.  For this reason, I implemented pseudo account-history that is simply tied to your user name.  If you opt-in for logging, a link to your history page will appear in the chat box as soon as you join the lobby.  There is technically nothing stopping you from "logging in" as a different user, other than that there doesn't seem to be much point to it.  If this kind of fraud happens a lot and people start complaining with /feedback, then I will make this more secure.  For now, happy playing!
