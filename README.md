# Introduction
This is an unabashed attempt to recreate the game GeoSense (geosense.net), which went offline some time after ~2012.
I have seen a few discussions on Reddit and elsewhere about people asking if it will ever go back online, but no one 
seems to have made an effort to bring it back.

I am a complete novice at Javascript and node.js but I made an attempt to throw this together anyway.

Feel free to contribute!

# Getting Started

This is a simple starting point for a HTML5 game using Canvas, Sockets.io and Express.

To start using me, here's what you'll have to do:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

The start script runs webpack in watch mode, and nodemon, so any changes you make to the client or server directories should cause webpack to rebuild and the server to restart, respectively. Note that you may need to wait a moment for the webpack build to complete - if you refresh the page too soon, you may not see your changes.
